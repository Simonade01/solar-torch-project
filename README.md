# 🌞 Solar Torch Project

### About
The Solar Torch Project is a student-led initiative to design, build, and distribute affordable solar-powered torches for families and students in communities with limited electricity access.

### Why This Matters
Millions of students struggle to study at night due to unreliable power. Our goal is to provide a sustainable, low-cost solution using solar energy.

### What We’ve Done
- ✅ Designed and built a working prototype using simple materials  
- ✅ Documented the design, materials, and costs  
- ✅ Distributed our first torches to local students and shop owners  
- ✅ Created this open-source repo so others can replicate it  

### How to Build One
See the [tutorials](tutorials/) folder for step-by-step guides.

### Project Structure

### Impact
- 🏠 Families reached: 0 (pilot phase starting soon)  
- 🎓 Students supported: 0 (first workshop in planning)  
- 🔋 Cost per torch: estimated at ~$3.50 each  

### Next Steps
- Scale up production to 10 torches by October 2025  
- Host a local workshop in school to teach peers about solar energy  
- Publish a YouTube tutorial + share on GitHub Pages  
- Explore crowdfunding (Kickstarter/GoFundMe) to expand to 100 torches
